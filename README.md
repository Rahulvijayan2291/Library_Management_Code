# Library Management API â€“ Spring Boot

This project is a **REST API service** built using **Spring Boot** for managing a library. The API supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage book information. This implementation is designed for easy testing and scalability.

---

## Features
- **Add a Book**: Add new book details to the library.
- **Update a Book**: Modify information about an existing book.
- **Retrieve All Books**: Fetch the details of all books in the library.
- **Delete a Book**: Remove a book from the library using its unique ID.

## Book Attributes
Each book record includes the following attributes:

| Attribute        | Type    | Description                                                        |

## Sample Book JSON
Here is an example of the JSON representation of a book object:

```json
{
  "ISBN": "9780061120084",
  "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird",
  "author": "Harper Lee",
  "description": "A novel set in the American South during the 1930s, focusing on the trial of a black man accused of raping a white woman.",
  "genre": "Fiction",
  "publicationYear": 1960,
  "copiesAvailable": 5,
  "publisher": "J. B. Lippincott & Co.",
  "coverImageUrl": "https://via.placeholder.com/150"
}
```

## Prerequisites
- **Java 11 or higher**
- **Maven**

## Getting Started

### Running the Application
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-api.git
   cd library-management-api
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

3. Test the application:
   ```bash
   mvn clean test
   ```

---

## Database
This application uses an **in-memory H2 database** for testing purposes. No additional setup is required as the database resets between application restarts.

To view the database during runtime:
1. Enable the H2 console in `application.properties`:
   ```properties
   spring.h2.console.enabled=true
   ```
2. Access the console at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`.
3. Use the following credentials:
   - **URL**: `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`
   - **User**: `sa`
   - **Password**: (leave blank)

---

## Running Tests
The project includes unit tests for the CRUD operations using Spring's `MockMvc`. The tests are located in the `src/test/java/com/example/library/` directory.

To execute tests:
```bash
mvn clean test
```

---

## Troubleshooting
### Port Already in Use
If you encounter a `port already in use` error, terminate the process using:
```bash
fuser -k 8080/tcp
```
Alternatively, update the port in `application.properties`:
```properties
server.port=8081
```

---

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building REST APIs.
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database for testing.
- **JUnit**: Testing framework.
- **Maven**: Dependency and build management.
